"Building a Simple Expense Tracker with Flask"
Slide 1: Introduction
•
Purpose of the Project: A web-based application to track and categorize expenses efficiently.
•
Key Features:
o
Add and categorize expenses.
o
Generate reports for spending analysis.
Slide 2: Technologies Used
•
Programming Language: Python
•
Framework: Flask (for web development)
•
Libraries:
o
datetime for date manipulation.
o
collections.defaultdict for expense categorization.
•
Frontend: HTML templates with Flask's render_template.
Slide 3: Project Architecture
•
Routes in the Application:
1.
/ - Displays all expenses (Home).
2.
/add - Handles expense addition via a form (POST request).
3.
/report - Generates and displays categorized expense reports.
•
Data Storage:
o
In-memory storage:
▪
A list (expenses) for ordered storage.
▪
A dictionary (expenses_by_category) for category-wise grouping.
Slide 4: Code Walkthrough
•
Core Functionalities:
o
Route: /: Displays the list of expenses using index.html.
python
Copy code
@app.route('/')
def index():
return render_template('index.html', expenses=expenses)
o
Route: /add: Handles form submission to add new expenses.
▪
Parses data from the form and appends it to the list and dictionary.
▪
Example:
python
Copy code
expense = {
'category': category,
'amount': amount,
'date': datetime.datetime.strptime(date, "%Y-%m-%d").date(),
'description': description
}
expenses.append(expense)
expenses_by_category[category].append(expense)
o
Route: /report: Generates a sorted and categorized report.
python
Copy code
sorted_expenses = sorted(expenses, key=lambda x: x['date'])
total_spent_by_category = {cat: sum(exp['amount'] for exp in exp_list)
for cat, exp_list in expenses_by_category.items()}
Slide 5: Frontend Templates

Slide: Introduction to the Expense Tracker Project
Overview
•
A web-based application to track and categorize expenses.
•
Built using:
o
Flask for backend logic.
o
HTML/CSS and Bootstrap for front-end design.
•
Incorporates DSA principles to manage and process data efficiently.
Slide: Key Use of DSA in the Project
1. expenses List
•
Purpose: Stores all expenses sequentially to preserve insertion order.
•
DSA Principle:
o
Implements dynamic arrays for efficient addition.
o
Operation Complexity:
▪
Append: O(1)O(1)O(1).
▪
Sorting: O(nlog⁡n)O(n \log n)O(nlogn) (when generating reports).
2. expenses_by_category Dictionary
•
Purpose: Categorizes expenses using a hash map (Python defaultdict).
•
DSA Principle:
o
Efficiently maps categories to expense lists.
o
Operation Complexity:
▪
Insertion/Retrieval: O(1)O(1)O(1) on average.
Why Hash Maps?
•
Provide constant-time operations for lookups and updates, critical for summarizing expenses by category.
3. Sorting Algorithm for Reporting
•
Purpose: Ensures that expenses are displayed in chronological order.
•
DSA Principle:
o
Sorting the list of expenses by date using Python’s Timsort.
o
Operation Complexity:
▪
Best Case: O(n)O(n)O(n) (already sorted).
▪
Worst Case: O(nlog⁡n)O(n \log n)O(nlogn).
4. Report Generation Logic
•
Total Calculation by Category:
o
Uses list comprehensions and hash map traversal to sum up amounts for each category.
o
Operation Complexity:
▪
Summation for a category: O(k)O(k)O(k), where kkk is the number of expenses in that category.
Slide: DSA Advantages in the Project
1. Improved Data Management
•
Hash maps group expenses by category efficiently.
•
Lists maintain ordered data for chronological display.
2. Performance Optimization
•
Sorting algorithms ensure quick report generation even for large datasets.
•
Constant-time operations in hash maps avoid bottlenecks during category lookups.
3. Scalability
•
Data structures like lists and hash maps handle increasing data volumes without significant performance degradation.
